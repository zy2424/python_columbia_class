# Questions

1) instantiate a variable called x with the value 4 and add 17 to it.

2) instantiate a variable called store with the value 256 and subtract 170 from it.

3) instantiate a variable called result with the value 1 and divide it by 12.

4) instantiate a variable called result with the value 12 and use integer division to divide it by 3.

5) instantiate a variable called name with the value "my name is" and then add the string " bob" to it.

6) instantiate a variable called scream with the value "a" and then multiply it by 1000.

7) instantiate a variable called input_variable with the value 37 and then store the result of 37 modulo 15 in a variable called result.

8) instantiate a variable called input_variable with the value 24 and then store the result of 24 modulo 2 in a variable called result.

9) instantiate a variable called x with the value 2, and a second variable called result with the value 0.  Write a flow of control statement with the following logic: if x is less than 2 result is now equal 27, else if x is greater than 2 result is now equal to 54 or else result is now equal to 100.

10) instantiate a variable called x with the value 3, and a second variable called result with the value 0.  Write a flow of control statement with the following logic: if x is less than 20 result is now equal 17, if x is less than or equal to 17 result is now equal to 5, else result is now equal to -1.

11) instantiate a variable called x with the value 2, and a second variable called result with the value 0.  Write a flow of control statement with the following logic: if x is divisable by 2 result is now equal to "divisible by 2", else result is now equal to "not divisible by 2".

12) instantiate a variable called x with the value 317, and a second variable called result with the value 0.  Write a flow of control statement with the following logic: if x is divisable by 3 result is now equal to "divisible by 3", else result is now equal to "not divisible by 3".

13) instantiate a variable called x with the value 500, and a second variable called result with the value 0.  Write a flow of control statement with the following logic: 

if x is divisable by 3 result is now equal to value plus 27 times 654. 

else result is now equal to value plus 54 times 12.

14) instantiate a variable called x with the value -1.5912397 and multiple it by minus one.

15) instantiate a variable called x with the value -12 and multiple it by negative 2.  Then instantiate another variable called result with 6 times the current value of x.

16) instantiate a variable called name with the value "charles" and instantiate another variable called result with the third character of name.  You must index into the string to get this value.

17) instantiate a variable called name with the value "charles" and instantiate another variable called result with the last character of name.  You must index into the string to get this value.

18) instantiate a variable called name with the value "charles" and instantiate another variable called result with the first character of name.  You must index into the string to get this value.

19) instantiate a variable called name with the value "action jackson" and instantiate another variable called result with the first character of name.  You must index into the string to get this value.

20) instantiate a variable called name with the value "charles in charge" and instantiate another variable called result with the index of the first whitespace character of name.  

21) instantiate a variable called name with the value "jam" and instantiate another variable called result with name plus " box".  

22) instantiate a variable called result with the result of True and False.

23) instantiate a variable called result with the result of True and True.

24) instantiate a variable called result with the result of False and True.

25) instantiate a variable called result with the result of False and False.

26) instantiate a variable called result with the result of True or False.

27) instantiate a variable called result with the result of True or True.

28) instantiate a variable called result with the result of False or True.

29) instantiate a variable called result with the result of False or False.

29) instantiate a variable called result with the result of not False.
