# Instructions

Write one python file.  Each function should be named as follows:

question_[number of question]

So question one would be:

question_1

And question two would be:

question_2

# Questions

Python basics - functions and software engineering foundations.

1) Write a function that takes in a parameter called name and returns "Hello my name is" plus the name.

2) Write a function that takes in a parameter called name and returns "Hello my name is" plus the capitalization of name.

3) Write a function that takes in a parameter called name and returns "My first name is" plus the name.

4) Write a function that takes in a parameter called name and returns "My first name is" plus the capitalization of name.

5) Write a function that takes in two parameters called first_name and last_name returns "My full name is" plus the first_name and last_name.

6) Write a function that takes in two parameters called first_name and last_name returns "My full name is" plus the capitalization of first_name and last_name.

7) Write a function that takes in a string and returns the indices of the string that are lower case.

8) Write a function that takes in a string and returns the indices of the string that are upper case.

9) Write a function that takes in a string and returns the indices of the string that are white spaces.

10) Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number of distinct words in the string.

11) Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number integers in the string.

12) Write a function that takes in two strings and concatenates them.

13) Write a function that takes in two strings and capitalizes them and then concatenates them.

14) Write a function that takes in a string and then replaces spaces with `_`.

15) Write a function that takes in a list of strings and then returns the longest word.

16) Write a function that takes in a list of strings and then returns the shortest word.

17) Write a function that takes in a list of strings and then returns the average word length.

18) Write a function that takes in a list of strings and then returns the median word length.

19) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the even numbers.

20) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the odd numbers.

21) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns three largest numbers.

22) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns three smallest numbers.

23) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the mean.

24) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the mode.

25) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the list in reverse.

26) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the cumulative sum of the list of numbers.

27) Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and then returns the difference between each number and the next number.  Hint: the returned list should have one less number than the input list.

28) Write a recursive function whose base cases are F[0] = 0, F[1] = 1, F[2] = 1 and who's nth case is F[n-1] + F[n-3]

29) Write a recursive function whose base case is F[0] = 1 and who's nth case is 

F[n-1] * F[n-2] * F[n-3] * ... * 2 * 1

30) Write a recursive function whose base case is F[0] = 1 and who's nth case is

2^F[n-1] * 2^F[n-2] * 2^F[n-3] * ... * 2^2 * 2^1 * 2^0
