# Questions

Python basics - iteration and data structures - while loops, for loops, lists, dictionaries, sets.

1) intialize a variable called counter with the value zero and another variable called value with the value five.  Then write a while loop that terminates when value is greater than 10.  In the while loop you should increase value by one and counter by one.

2) intialize a variable called counter with the value zero and another variable called value with the value 2.  Then write a while loop that terminates when value is greater than 120.  In the while loop you should increase value by two and counter by one.

3) intialize a variable called counter with the value zero and another variable called value with the value negative 50.  Then write a while loop that terminates when value is less than negative 100.  In the while loop you should decrease value by one and increase counter by one.

4) intialize a variable called counter with the value zero and another variable called value with the value 7.  Then write a while loop that terminates when value is greater than 1e7.  In the while loop you should increase value by multiplying it one half of it's current value and increase counter by one.

5) intialize a variable called counter with the value zero and another variable called value with the value 10000.  Then write a while loop that terminates when value is less than or equal to 1.  In the while loop you should decrease value by dividing it one half of it's current value and increase counter by one.

6) initialize a list called listing with the values 0, 1, and 2.  Now initialize a variable called result by selecting the third element of the list.  

7) initialize a list called listing with the values 0, 1, and 2.  Now initialize a variable called result by selecting the last element of the list.

8) initialize a list called listing with the values "A", 1, and 7.  Now initialize a variable called result by selecting the first element of the list.  Next lower case result and store that value in result.

9) initialize a list called listing with the values "aloha", 1, and 7.  Now initialize a variable called result by selecting the first element of the list.  Next capitalize result and store that value in result.

10) initialize a list called listing with the 100 random integers in the range 0, 10.  Now sort the list. Now initialize a variable called result by selecting the first element of the list.  

11) initialize a variable called listing with a list comprehension that goes from 2 to 100.

12) initialize a variable called listing with a list comprehension that goes from 2 to 100 and only includes even values.

13) initialize a variable called listing with a list comprehension that goes from 2 to 100 and only includes odd values.

14) initialize a variable called listing with a list comprehension that goes from 2 to 100 and only includes values if they are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both.

15) initialize a variable called listing with a list comprehension that goes from 100 to 5 inclusive.

16) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary comprehension that has keys from 2 to 100 and has True for all values.

17) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary comprehension that has keys from 2 to 100 and has True for all values.

18) 17) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary comprehension that has keys from 2 to 100 and has True for all even values.

19) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary comprehension that has keys from 2 to 100 and has True for all odd values.

20) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary comprehension that has keys from 2 to 100 and has True for all values divisible by 7 or 17.

21) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary that has keys with the written words for one to ten and values with the integer values 1 to 10, where each word associates with it's number.

22) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary that has keys 0 to 100 and each value is the key plus one.

23) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary that has keys 0 to 100 and each value is the key times 2.

24) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary that has keys 0 to 100 and each value is the key divided by it's largest prime factor.  For a prime number these will always be 1.

25) initialize a variable called dicter with a dictionary that has keys 0 to 100 and each value is the key divided by it's smallest prime factor.  For a prime number these will always be 1.

26) intiailize a variable called listing with 10000 random integers between 0 and 10.  Then create a variable called result that is a list of unique values in the list.

27) intiailize a variable called listing with 10000 random integers between 0 and 10.  Then create a variable called result that is a list of unique values in the list, in the order they first appear in listing.

28) intiailize a variable called listing with 10000 random integers between 0 and 10.  Then create a variable called value_counts that is a dictionary where the keys are each value in the listing variable and the  values are the number of occurrences of each number.

29) intiailize a variable called listing with 10000 random integers between 0 and 10.  Then create a variable called value_ratios that is a dictionary where the keys are each value in the listing variable and the values are the ratio of the number of occurrences of each number to the total size of the list.
